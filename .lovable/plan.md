## Replace Ad with Responsive Version

The uploaded file (`practice-daily-ad_2-2.html`) is a responsive update of the animated advertisement. It uses CSS `transform: scale()` with media queries to scale the 1024x768 design down for smaller viewports (tablets, phones), fixing the current issue where the ad doesn't adapt on mobile.

### What Changes

1. **Overwrite `public/images/practice-daily-ad.html`** with the new uploaded file (`practice-daily-ad_2-2.html`).

### What Stays the Same

- No changes to `src/pages/Landing.tsx` -- the iframe reference and container dimensions remain identical.
- All other landing page sections, routing, and functionality are untouched.
